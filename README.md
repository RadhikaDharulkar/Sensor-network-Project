# Sensor-network-Project
A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wireless network consisting of spatially distributed nodes to monitor physical or environmental conditions or just establish a connection in an area. The WSN is built of nodes and is usually used for monitoring purposes like process or health monitoring, remote environmental monitoring, etc. Such a network is typically made of thousands of nodes with each node consisting of a transmitter and a receiver to establish a connection between nearby nodes. Each node can only communicate with another node within a certain range and hence to establish a connection over the entire area, careful distribution of nodes is very crucial. In this project, we implement an algorithm for determining a coloring, terminal clique, and a selection of bipartite subgraphs that are produced by an algorithm for graph coloring in a random geometric Graph (RGG). These results model a wireless sensor network (WSN) with each bipartite subgraph providing a communication backbone.
